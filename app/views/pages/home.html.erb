            <p>Welcome to the Oregon State University Course Review website. This
            tool was created by students in the School of Engineering's Online
            eCampus program, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
            The purpose of this tool is to provide visible feedback about course
            content and instructor quality as a resource for the benefit of future
            students. The reviews you find here were written by actual students. Anyone
            can view the content. If you would like to contribute a review to this
            site, you will need to sign in using your ONID name and password to verify
            that you have taken the class which you are reviewing.</p>
